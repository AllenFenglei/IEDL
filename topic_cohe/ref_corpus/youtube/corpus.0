why do the main keyboard lag the piss out of my device when i want to type 1 video description and 2 video title . it have be bug me for awhile now , and it be start to get ridiculous . what happen ? i would prefer the previous update if this happen , no thank for this update . god damn update the fps issue on the upload page like a place where u can upload ur video .
the recently implement feature which make it that if the side of the screen be tap , the video either fast forward or rewinds , be extremely annoy as it cause many accidental time skip . you've previously have icon beside the pause button instal for this feature and i feel that this would be a much more effective place for this command as it eliminate this annoyance . please remove this feature asap . thank you .
