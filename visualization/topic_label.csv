topic9,13.560232,real world; genetic algorithm; compute power; lstm model; neural network,0,October,1: i'm start to get_into the ai field and want a a side project to try and make an_algorithm to play old game;<br>2: what make the ai in sci_fi fundamentally_different from real exist ai be that it be a;<br>3: which introduce the q_learn function in context it be_an_excellent work that model learn in a way that be independent_from whether the learning be biological or program on a computer draw on mdp;<br>4: it be a's object in the game to try and cause c to make the wrong identification;<br>5: the game cause a difference_in the fitness because i_cannot make all round same easily;<br>,10
topic9,14.828534,neural network; time step; gradient descent; side effect; mini batch,0,November,1: a input a normal pen paper personality test be use which be develop_by serious psychologist and this game get transform_into a chatbot database;<br>2: data after normalization network summary the train fail with the follow error after some troubleshooting i realise_that the prediciton output show nan value;<br>3: <digit> base_on the reward receive in move from state to use action be update;<br>4: consider this a model_free approach where the agent be sample action from the environment and get <digit> energy output from the learned model a a reward;<br>5: how_do you calculate the loss when_you only have the <digit> move that be play in the game to work_with;<br>,11
topic9,8.420665,data preprocess; stop word; loss function; take place; heuristic value,0,December,1: 100_000 be a bit excessive for most game but it just have to be large_enough that a loss win and draw be never confuse a a draw in <digit> <digit> move would look good_than a win in <digit>;<br>2: undo any move the bot make that be illegal and then get it to move again;<br>3: naively move a be well but in this game the only legal_move follow move a lead_to a loss and move b lead_to a position where min have hundred_of legal_move but only_one cause him to win;<br>4: for the first value if place a token here would result in a connect_4 for player_1 it's a otherwise a for the second value if place a token would get player_2 a connect_4 then it's a otherwise a so if no_one would win by place a token here it's two value for these_two input two final value the first indicate_whether it's player_1 '_s turn or not then second indicate if_it's player_2 '_s turn or not what i see when my bot be play be that it make what i_assume be somewhat clever move like it's preparing for both horizontal and diagonal move;<br>5: this subjective representation will change in_real_time a the robot move and discover_new information;<br>,12
