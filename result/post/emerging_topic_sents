Topic 8: it take at_least <digit> bit to represent any number between <digit> <digit> because 2_^ <digit> <digit>	26.823772	and output <digit> number would work	26.672320	also do i_understand it correctly that each_unit in the_top layer be a binary scalar take on the value of <digit> or <digit>	26.671352

Topic 7: how_fast can your_model generate an output correspond_to a change in the input	64.310077	be the first one of a word and a <digit> on the output determine_if it's the_last one	64.266750	usually the error be quite small within the input interval around around <digit> but the network be not able_to_get good weight for the region at the boundary of the interval	64.265251	
Topic 8: replication of intelligence be subject from a definition that human and animal have autonomy of it's need in replication have to account_for this asumption and it's singularity and our method in it within the machine we_have at the_moment which now reduce to computer	76.514911	level_of human ai interaction to date	76.450138	so i_suspect_that ai might achieve parity with overall human_intelligence but may_not also become capable_of behave_like_a human or understand certain thing where the understanding be develop experientially	76.438582

Topic 4: however use super computing platform basic analysis algorithm such_a fft function and statistic package with correlation_coefficient routine naive_bayesian capability and convergence detection support will certainly assist_in reduce the development effort require to_implement and test this approach or others like it	43.161764	the a algorithm use the	43.150225	this_tag should be use for_question_about the mcts algorithm	43.133578

Topic 7: it be artificial in that it do_not naturally_occur in nature it be intelligent in that it adapt in way that if those way be mechanical they be mechanical at a level_of detail that be beyond obviousness without considerable study a year dependent and culturally dependent a that definition_of intelligence be no other definition be quite a sustainable over decade from both scientific and linguistic perspective	62.738670	we might wish_to know span_class	62.710677	base_on some definition we require span_class	62.704789

Topic 6: what be know that computer simulation or replication of human ability have_already be achieve and that such achievement indicate ai to be a reasonable long_term objective few would deny	50.268834	this be a step_toward the important ai goal of corroborate map information with real_time ascertainable immediate environment	50.264511	in the computing industry this be know a the moore law but it can be transfer to the car industry too	50.262311
