Topic 0:i use imblearn library with python 3.6 for preprocess data	1.320200	besides oop language such_a java_c and python have library that significantly simplify the process of program a neural_network	1.254816	with so_many option it be useful to get analysis of hardware component back_up by fact and data	1.222175	with neural_network you simply classify data	1.182426	the term become a buzzword and be now often apply to business analytics or_even arbitrary use of data or use a a sexed up term for statistic	1.180678	
Topic 1:of the ai would be to act a a filter not relay any request for release back only the answer to the question ask	1.337272	if_you read_through the abstract of chess ai paper it be often point_out_that human	1.191369	after study and get answer from expert i could find_out the answer to this_question and posting a an answer to my_own question	1.168661	i see that too but in case of the human in the way i look_at it we be at the very_low step beginning of an_ai that can do self reflect and question it_own ability_to do rational thinking and how_far it can go and develop	1.144401	i'm_think that you_could write an_ai that take the question a input weight it and google info base_on the first_layer of neuron then take the first two to three page of result and spit_out an answer	1.129339	
Topic 2:an_ai look_at a new problem try_to remember the most_similar problem with a know solution and apply a similar solution to the new problem	1.309266	there_seem to be a bit too_little ground truth information in each image	1.233591	as_far_a i_understand the hill_climb_algorithm be a local_search_algorithm that select any random solution a an_initial solution to start the search	1.188972	you develop a technique to_solve a_particular problem you apply that technique the technique seem_to be general enough people start to apply that same technique to various problem people get excite that this be the silver_bullet they be look_for the technique start to show it limitation and doesn't_work for many problem hype get shatter start over	1.169150	histopathological_image compare_to natural_image difference so that in histopathological_image the image need_to be model may_contain million_of pixel whereas a recognition from natural_image that this be a dog house certain person need significantly_less information to be extract_from the picture	1.122076
